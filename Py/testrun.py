# Create ao add all the numbers from 1 to 10 and print the sum.  Use a while loop.
# Hint:  Use a variable to keep track of the sum as you iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10.
# Hint2:  Use a variable to increment the number by 1 each time through the loop.
# Hint3:  Use a while loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10.
# Hint4:  Use the print() function to print the sum.
# Hint5:  Use the += operator to add the number to the sum variable.
# Hint6:  Use the print() function to print the sum.

# Create a variable to keep track of the sum
sum = 0
while sum < 10:
    sum += 1
